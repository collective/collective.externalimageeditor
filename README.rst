Description
============

This package will add links on Images to edit them on external webservices.
It works for:

    - Archetypes image fields
    - ATImages

The activation of those services is controlled by settings in a specific control panel on the plone site setup.


Currently, we support only pixlr, fotoflexer and aviary.

You can view a `Demo <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCCJelVmYOE>`_.

Note that we integrate plone.protect to ensure a minimum level of security against CSRF attacks.
